      <description>One of the reasons I switched to Mac when Windows 8 came out was Mac&amp;rsquo;s UNIX-y background. I liked being able to open a terminal and do all the things I had been learning about in my computer science classes. Mac&amp;rsquo;s default shell is Bash, or the Bourne Again SHell. Sure, I could cd around, ls directories, and cp or mv things. But, I knew I was not even close to tapping the power of the shell.</description>

      <description>How does one begin to use VIM? This is a question that has been asked many times around the internets. The only answer I can give is to dive in and start using.
Along the way I have found a few resources to be helpful. Definitely start with the vimtutor. It takes 30 minutes to read and play around with. Once finished, you should feel comfortable writing in INSERT mode and moving around in NORMAL mode.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my first post!
My goals with this blog are:
 Focus on computer science and mathematical concepts. Learn about static-site generators&amp;mdash;like this one, Hugo&amp;mdash;and web hosting. Become more proficient with tools like Linux and Vim.  </description>
