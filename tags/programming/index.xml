      <description>How does one begin to use VIM? This is a question that has been asked many times around the internets. The only answer I can give is to dive in and start using.
Along the way I have found a few resources to be helpful. Definitely start with the vimtutor. It takes 30 minutes to read and play around with. Once finished, you should feel comfortable writing in INSERT mode and moving around in NORMAL mode.</description>
